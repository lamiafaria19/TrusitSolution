<p><strong>If your debt is past the statute of limitations, you are hereby notified of the following

over for filing a lawsuit to recover this debt if you take specific action such as making a
payment, or a written promise to pay. You should determine the effect of any action you take

						Collectors may not use false or misleading statements or call you at work
						if they know or have reason to know that you may not receive personal calls at work.
						For the most part, collectors may not tell another person, other than your attorney or spouse,
						about your debt. Collectors may contact another person to confirm your location or enforce a judgment.
						For more information about debt collection activities, you may contact the Federal Trade Commission

<u>“Debt collection agency” shall mean a person, firm or corporation engaged in business, the principal purpose of which is to regularly collect or attempt to collect debts: (a) owed or due or asserted to be owed or due to another; or (b) obtained by, or assigned to, such person, firm or corporation, that are in default when obtained or acquired by such person, firm or corporation.</u>
<br><br>
If a creditor or debt collector receives a money judgment against you in court, state and federal laws may prevent the following types of income from being taken to pay the debt: 1. Supplemental security income, (SSI); 2. Social security; 3. Public assistance (welfare); 4. Spousal support, maintenance (alimony) or child support; 5. Unemployment benefits; 6. Disability benefits; 7. Workers’ compensation benefits; 8. Public or private pensions; 9. Veterans’ benefits; 10. Federal student loans, federal student grants, and federal work study funds; and 11. Ninety percent of your wages or salary earned in the last sixty days.
<br><br>
This collection agency, in accordance with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. §1692 et seq., is prohibited from engaging in abusive, deceptive, and unfair debt collection efforts, including but not limited to: (i) the use or threat of violence; (ii) the use of obscene or profane language; and (iii) repeated phone calls made with the intent to annoy, abuse, or harass.

The New York State Department of Financial Services (23 NYCRR 1.2(b)(2)) requires the following disclosure for charged-off debts: Charges, fees or interest are not applicable or will not be charged.
<br><br>
<strong>For Deceased Collections:</strong><br>
<u>No principal creditors and/or debt collection agencies shall make any representation that a person is required to pay the debt of a family member in a way that contravenes with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (15 USC 1692 et seq.). In addition, the principal creditors and/or debt collection agencies shall not make any misrepresentation about the family member’s obligation to pay such debts.</u>
<br><br>
<strong>Debtor's Rights:</strong><br>
As a debtor who owes or may owe a consumer claim, you are given some protection and rights by the New York and federal laws regulating debt collection procedures. You should be aware of your rights.<br><br>
	•	A debt collector may contact you or any member of your family or household directly. However, they may not contact you with such frequency, at unusual hours, or in a manner that can be expected to abuse or harass you. They also cannot threaten action which they do not take in the usual course of business.<br><br>
	•	A debt collector may not threaten to contact your employer regarding a debt prior to obtaining a final judgment against you. However, a debt collector may contact your employer to execute a wage assignment agreement if you, the debtor, have agreed to the assignment.<br><br>
	•	A debt collector cannot use a communication which appears to be authorized, issued, or approved by a government agency or attorney when it is not.<br><br>
	•	A debt collector cannot disclose or threaten to disclose information affecting your reputation for creditworthiness if the collector know
	or has reason to know the information is false. A debt collector also cannot attempt or threaten to enforce a right when it knows or has reason to know the right does not exist.<br><br>
	•	For more information about your rights under state and federal debt collection procedures law, contact the Consumer Protection Division of the New York State

<strong>If your debt is past the statute of limitations, you are hereby notified of the following
important consumer information:</strong><br><br>
We are required by regulation of the New York State Department of Financial Services to notify you of the following information. This information is NOT legal advice: Your creditor or debt collector believes that the legal time limit (statute of limitations) for suing you to collect this debt may have expired. It is a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692 et seq., to sue to collect on a debt for which the state of limitations has expired. However, if the creditor sues you to collect on this debt, you may be able to prevent the creditor from obtaining a judgment against you. To do so, you must tell the court that the statute of limitations has expired. Even though the Statute of Limitations has expired, you may choose to make payments. However, be aware: if you make a payment, admit to owing the debt, promise to pay the debt, or waive the statute of limitations of the debt, the time period in which the debt is enforceable in court may start again. If you would like to learn more about your legal rights and options, you can consult an attorney or a legal assistance or legal aid organization.
